# Engine card — only what a design decision depends on

Every line here was read out of the source during this skill's construction and carries its
citation. **Nothing was copied from anywhere.** If a fact you need is not here, go read
`apps/game_generation/twee_comprehensive/generators/v2.py` (referred to below as `v2.py`) and
add it *with* its `file:line`. Never assert engine behaviour from memory — this file exists
because memory was wrong twice while it was being written.

Paths are relative to `story_gen_web_app/story_gen_django/`.

---

## 1. `is_repeatable` defaults to TRUE when the key is absent

```python
v2.py:10937   "is_repeatable": trigger.is_repeatable if trigger else True
v2.py:11010   is_repeatable = getattr(trigger, 'is_repeatable', True) if trigger else True
apps/stories/models.py:355   is_repeatable = models.BooleanField(default=True, ...)
```

**Why it matters for design:** a canvas with no `is_repeatable` key is standing content, not a
one-shot. Assuming otherwise inverts your read of what the game actually is. A grep-based pass
that assumed `false` reported one game as 33% repeatable when the majority was repeatable.

---

## 2. Conditions **fail open** without `version = "1.0"`

```js
v2.py:3820   if (!conditions.version || conditions.version !== '1.0') return true;
```

**Why it matters:** a gate missing its `version` passes for everybody, silently, with a green
build and no error. Every `conditions` block you author carries `version = "1.0"`.

Shape:

```toml
conditions = { version = "1.0", logic = "AND", items = [
  { type = "flag",  subject = "player", flag_key  = "…", operator = "is_true" },
  { type = "trait", subject = "player", trait_key = "…", operator = "gte", value = 20 },
] }
```

---

## 3. Effects say `trait`. Conditions say `trait_key`.

Same concept, different key, and mixing them up is invisible:

```toml
# CONDITION
{ type = "trait", subject = "player", trait_key = "corruption", operator = "gte", value = 20 }

# EFFECT
{ targetType = "player", trait = "corruption", op = "add", value = 2, clamp = true }
```

Effects live at `nodes[].exit_block.config.effects` and `nodes[].exit_block.choices[].effects`.
Flags use `flagEffects` with the key `flag`, at the same two places.

**`clamp = true` matters.** Unclamped effects can drive a trait negative or past its top band,
and a value outside every band makes the sidebar row silently vanish.

---

## 4. Meter ceilings live in `sidebar_items[].bands[]`

Not in `[player.core_traits]`, which is a flat `{ key = initial_value }` map with no maxima.

```toml
[[sidebar_items]]
type  = "trait_status_text"
trait = "corruption"
bands = [ { min = 0, max = 24, text = "…" }, … ]
```

A top band with **no** `max` is unbounded by design and promises nothing. A top band *with* a
`max` is a promise: content must exist up to it.

---

## 5. Media: a fixed file, or a folder that cycles

```toml
{ type = "video", props = { file = "sex/thing_t5.webm", description = "…", search_queries = […] } }
{ type = "video", props = { pool_dir = "sex/thing_t5", pool = 4, description = "…", search_queries = […] } }
```

```python
v2.py:11888   def _resolve_pool_dir(self, pool_dir)     # contents discovered from disk
v2.py:11902   def _media_pool_key(...)                  # cycle state key
v2.py:11908   # ... $game_state.media_cycle
v2.py:11872-11874  # `pool_dir` is preferred: the count is never hardcoded, so the human curates
```

Pools **cycle** (1→2→3→1) through `$game_state.media_cycle` rather than re-rolling, so the
player never sees the same clip twice running. `pool_dir` is preferred over an explicit file
list because the count comes from disk.

Media blocks also appear nested — under group blocks (`blocks[].blocks[].props`) and inside
cascade beats (`blocks[].props.beats[].blocks[].props`). Any tool walking media must recurse.

---

## 6. Schedules, and overnight windows

```toml
[[npcs.schedules]]
location = "…"; weekdays = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]; start_time = "22:00"; end_time = "04:00"; activity = "…"
```

**Wrapping past midnight is supported.** From `setup.isCurrentTimeSlot` in `v2.py`:

```js
// Handle overnight (e.g., 22:00-06:00)
if (endTotal < startTotal) return currentTotal >= startTotal || currentTotal < endTotal;
```

Call sites: `v2.py:3448`, `:3465`, `:3612`. An omitted `end_time` defaults to start + 60 min
(same function).

⚠️ An older note in our own memory claims a window cannot cross midnight and needs two rows.
The source above contradicts it. Either the engine was fixed or the original observation was
about a different path — **verify live before splitting a window.**

---

## 7. Random events have a per-location cooldown

```js
v2.py:5190   var cooldowns = sv.game_state.random_cooldowns = sv.game_state.random_cooldowns || {};
             // after a random event fires, skip N visits before rolling again
```

Cooldown is engine-managed per location — do not author your own. Random canvases are
selected by `triggerMode === "random"`.

`max_triggers_per_day` is read per trigger (`v2.py:11011`).

---

## 8. Linking between canvases

```toml
[[canvases.nodes.exit_block.choices]]
text = "…"; targetType = "node"; nodeId = "<canvas_id>.<node_id>"
```

A canvas with **no** `trigger` block is a link target — it has no location of its own and
inherits its context from whatever links into it. Substitutions use
`trigger.substitutions[].target_canvas_id`.

`show_when_locked = true` on a choice renders it greyed and visible instead of hidden. This is
the mechanism behind "every release ends on a visible locked door."

---

## 9. Narration person is per-game and immutable

```toml
[settings]
narration_person = "second"   # or "first" / "third"
```

Declared once. Changing it after a release rewrites every line of prose in the game.

---

## 10. The location graph — children forward, "Leave X" back

`navigation_order` lists **children only**. The validator enforces it:

> `navigation_order for 'her_room' includes 'the_landing' which is not a destination
> (entry_from != 'her_room')`

The return link is **generated automatically** from `entry_from` and renders as
**`Leave <Location Name>`** — not as the parent's name. A room with
`navigation_order = []` is therefore *not* a dead end.

```toml
[[locations]]
id = "the_landing"; entry_from = "the_front_room"
navigation_order = ["her_room", "the_bathroom", "the_box_room"]   # children

[[locations]]
id = "her_room";  entry_from = "the_landing";  navigation_order = []   # leaf, still exitable
```

Confirmed live: from `her_room` the only story links are `Change Clothes` and
`Leave Her Room`.

---

## 11. Validator rules that will stop a build

Each of these failed a real build during this skill's first use:

- **`trait_decay` values must be POSITIVE magnitudes.** `hygiene = -10` is rejected with
  *"must be >= 0"*. Write the amount to lose, not a delta.
- **`customizable = true` requires `[[player.customization_fields]]`.** Set it `false` unless
  you are actually shipping the fields.
- **`navigation_order` may only list children** (above).

---

## 12. The Start passage is an age gate, not the game

`Start` initialises state and then renders a title screen. The starting canvas is reached
through the gate link — `[[✓ I am 18 or older - Enter Game->StartingCanvas_<canvas>_Node_<node>]]`.
Nothing auto-plays before it, and `player.current_location` is `""` until the first canvas or
location passage runs.

**Consequence for any play-test harness:** click the age gate first, or you will conclude the
opening is broken when it is fine.

**Rendered links** are `a.link-internal` inside `#story`. A bare `text=` selector also matches
the embedded `<tw-passagedata>` source and will resolve to an invisible element.

---

## 13. Exit blocks use SECTION syntax, not nested inline tables

A multi-line inline table is a TOML parse error, and an `exit_block` with conditional choices
is unavoidably multi-line. Write it as sections — the shipped game does this 199 times:

```toml
[[canvases.nodes]]
id = "base"
blocks = [ … ]                       # arrays of inline tables are fine, even multi-line

[canvases.nodes.exit_block]
type = "choices"

[[canvases.nodes.exit_block.choices]]
text       = "Take him upstairs."
targetType = "node"
nodeId     = "loop_cal_sex.base"
conditions = { version = "1.0", logic = "AND", items = [
  { type = "trait", subject = "player", trait_key = "nerve", operator = "gte", value = 55 },
] }

# a location exit
[canvases.nodes.exit_block]
type = "location"
text = "Leave him to it."

[canvases.nodes.exit_block.config]
destinationType = "specific"
locationId      = "the_front_room"
time_progression_minutes = 30
effects = [ { targetType = "npc", npcId = "npc_cal", trait = "lust", op = "add", value = 2 } ]
```

`conditions = { … items = [ … ] }` *may* span lines, because newlines are legal inside the
array. Two levels of nesting is where it breaks.

---

## 14. The third key asymmetry — `npc_id` vs `npcId`

| | condition | effect |
|---|---|---|
| the trait | `trait_key` | `trait` |
| the character | `npc_id` | `npcId` |

```toml
{ type = "trait", subject = "npc", npc_id = "npc_cal", trait_key = "lust", operator = "gte", value = 20 }
{ targetType = "npc", npcId = "npc_cal", trait = "lust", op = "add", value = 3 }
```

---

## 15. `locked_text` REPLACES the choice label

A choice with `show_when_locked = true` renders as `<span class="locked-choice">`. If
`locked_text` is set, that string is shown **instead of** the action text — the player never
sees what the action was called.

**Trade-off, decide deliberately:** omit `locked_text` and the greyed row shows the action
("Stop pretending it's a secret") — a *want* the player can name, which is what sells the next
release. Set it and the row shows the reason instead ("Not yet — he still thinks he's getting
away with it") — clearer about the gate, weaker as a door. Prefer the want unless the gate is
genuinely obscure.

Verified live: at `nerve` 60 against a 75 gate, the row rendered as
`SPAN.locked-choice :: Not yet — he still thinks he's getting away with it.`

---

## 16. A flag read by a TRIGGER **or a CHOICE** must be set from a LOCATED canvas

The flag-chain validator **hard-fails the build** otherwise:

```
❌ Flag Chain Validation Failed:
   ✗ dean_open
     Required by: Dean (late)
     Issue: MISSING HINT - set by 'Come down in what you slept in' but no location/schedule
```

A triggerless rung has no location, so a flag set in its `exit_block` cannot be pointed at —
the game has no way to tell the player where to go and earn it.

**Fix: put the `flagEffects` on the hub CHOICE that opens the rung**, not on the rung's exit.
The choice lives on a located canvas, the semantics are identical (clicking the choice *is*
doing the scene), and the chain resolves.

```toml
[[canvases.nodes.exit_block.choices]]
text       = "Come down in what you slept in."
targetType = "node"
nodeId     = "rung_dean_morning.base"
flagEffects = [ { targetType = "player", flag = "dean_open", op = "set" } ]   # ← here
```

**It applies to choice conditions too, not only triggers.** Hit twice:

```
✗ dean_open          Required by: Dean (late)
                     set by 'Come down in what you slept in' but no location/schedule
✗ ray_arrangement    Required by: Ray
                     required by choice 'Sit with him after.',
                     set by 'Stop pretending it's a favour' but no location/schedule
```

Both were the same shape — a flag set in a triggerless rung's exit, then read to unlock
something. Both were fixed the same way: move the `flagEffects` up onto the located hub choice.

Flags that nothing reads in a trigger *or* a choice are unaffected — a triggerless rung may set
them freely.

---

## 17. The wardrobe — and the most dangerous failure class in this engine

**Granting a garment** is `wardrobeEffects` on an exit block's **config**:

```toml
[canvases.nodes.exit_block.config]
destinationType = "specific"
locationId      = "her_room"
wardrobeEffects = [
  { action = "add", item_id = "mothers_slip" },
]
```

Exact path: `canvases[].nodes[].exit_block.config.wardrobeEffects`. Fields are **`action`** and
**`item_id`** — not `op` / `itemId`.

**⚠️ THE FAILURE CLASS: an unrecognised key is silently ignored.** I first wrote
`clothingEffects = [{ itemId = "…", op = "grant" }]`. The TOML parsed, the validator passed, the
build went green, and **nothing was ever granted** — the top of the wardrobe would have been
permanently unreachable with no error anywhere.

Nothing in the pipeline catches this. The only defence is to **grep the importer for any key you
have not personally seen in a shipped game** before relying on it:

```
grep -rn "yourKeyName" apps/projects/services/template_import.py
```

Zero hits means the key does not exist, however plausible it looks.

**The catalog** is a top-level `[[clothing]]` array — `id`, `name`, `slot`, `image`, `initial`,
`beauty`, `corruption`. Slots: `bra`, `underwear`, `top`, `bottom`, `dress`, `legwear`, `shoes`.

**`worn_corruption` is a MAX aggregate, not a sum.** Verified live: with `sleep_vest` (2) worn,
equipping `mothers_slip` (7) moved the reading **2 → 7**. One loaded garment sets the number on
its own, so a catalog does not need to be large to reach a tier — it needs one item per tier.

This makes clothing a genuine gate source. Verified condition types: `worn_corruption`,
`worn_type`, `clothing_slot` (empty/filled — i.e. "not wearing a bra"), and `clothing_item`
with `equipped` / `unequipped` / `owned` / `not_owned`.

---

## 18. Build

```
python scripts/merge_toml_phases.py games/<slug>
python manage.py package_from_toml games/<slug>/toml_phases/7_final_game.toml \
    --output-dir games/<slug>/output --gen-version v2 [--video-folder <dir>] [--debug]
```

`merge_toml_phases.py` concatenates a fixed set of phase files into `7_final_game.toml`.
**Never hand-edit `7_final_game.toml`** — it is output.

⚠️ `--video-folder` gates external-asset copying. Omit it and the build is green while every
portrait, location and scene image 404s in the browser.
